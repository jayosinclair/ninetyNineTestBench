//TODO: Complete the Card class according to the specifications.


/*

The Card class should store a card’s suit and rank. Its constructor receives an integer from 0 to
51 and computes the suit and rank accordingly. (It isn’t necessary to keep the original number.)
The Card class should be able to return:
1. Its numeric suit and rank
2. Its standard name, e.g., Ace of Clubs or Three of Hearts.
AI Tip: Research how to solve this part using the toString method.

A convenient way to create the standard names is to define String arrays for the rank and
suit names, then use the numeric values as indices to retrieve the appropriate names. Each
card does NOT need its own copies of these String arrays, so declare them in a way that all
Card objects share the arrays.
